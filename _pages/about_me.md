I am a professor in the [Department of Sociology](https://lsu.edu/hss/sociology/) at LSU. 

**Research Interests:** My research broadly addresses the social patterning of health and religion. I am principally focused on the role that social characteristics (e.g., religion, social class, and ethnicity) play in population health. I have studied these topics in the general U.S. adult population and in groups such as older Hispanic Americans and South Asian Americans. I have also been involved in disaster and health research, focusing on child and parent health following the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. I am also interested in the causes and consequences of religious involvement more broadly. I have studied determinants of religious involvement and how religious ecologies and personal religiosity shape a variety of outcomes. In terms of research methods, I use quantitative methods to analyze data from social surveys and administrative databases. In addition to scholarly publications, my research has received coverage in media outlets such as The New York Times and The Washington Post. 

**Teaching:** I regularly teach Sociology of Medicine and Sociology of Religion at the undergraduate level. I have periodically taught graduate seminars including Sociology of Mental & Physical Health, Sociology of Religion, Data Visualization, and Methods of Social Investigation.

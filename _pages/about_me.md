I am a professor in the [Department of Sociology](https://lsu.edu/hss/sociology/) at LSU. 

**Research Interests:**
My research broadly addresses the social patterning of health and religion. I am principally focused on the role that social 		characteristics (e.g., religion, social class, and ethnicity) play in population health. I have studied these topics in the general U.S. adult population and in groups such as older Hispanic Americans and South Asian Americans. I have also been involved in disaster and health research, focusing on child and parent health following the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. I am also interested in the causes and consequences of religious involvement more broadly. I have studied determinants of religious involvement and how religious ecologies and personal religiosity shape a variety of outcomes. In terms of research methods, I use quantitative methods to analyze data from social surveys and administrative databases. You can find links to my published research on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=O_uxIIcAAAAJ&hl=en). In addition to scholarly publications, my research has received coverage in media outlets such as _The New York Times_ and _The Washington Post_. 

**Teaching:** I regularly teach Sociology of Medicine and Sociology of Religion at the undergraduate level. I have periodically taught graduate seminars including Sociology of Mental & Physical Health, Sociology of Religion, Data Visualization, and Methods of Social Investigation.
